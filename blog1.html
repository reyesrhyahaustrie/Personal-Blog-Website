                <p class="author">by Rhyah Austrie Reyes</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="first-part">
                    It was in mid-summer break, the year 2018 when someone knocked onto my life like an ethereal piece
                    of warmth humbly
                    forging me through his humorous jokes that made my heart feel that it is dancing on the sea of
                    clouds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Looking Back</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Originally, residing in Radar is not my family's thing back from 2013 to 2015, and treat our
                    property as some sort of an
                    unwinding area only after a hectic week where it felt like home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Little did I know that the 10-year old Rhyah will have a chance to meet a cool and kind boy named
                    Ian, as she wandered
                    the streets of Radar at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoonâ€” the time when kids used to play outside.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ian was always caught by my peripheral vision, as he held my lifeless frame sighting on me with a
                    wide-eyed gaze as I
                    do. Having a crush is normal but I never expected that all of a sudden, I would not be able to see
                    him for days, that
                    became weeks, to months, and to years.

                    <b>Tracing Forward</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As we catch up through Facebook Messenger the time we were interested in how's our life goingâ€” I
                    knew that we were both
                    aware that we have in-tacked childhood memories together back from 2013 to 2015. That catch-up has
                    become the center
                    point of our mutual relationship as you confessed to me at an unexpected time that you like me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Truly, it has been a teenage word connotated by the society, that when both like each other, it's
                    called 'mutual
                    understanding' type of relationship or the 'Walang Label' as they call it in Filipino term.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    May this be coined as puppy love, I knew that we were serious about our intentions for each other.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Blissful Memories</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though we were both in the same neighborhood, it turned out to be that we're not studying in
                    the same school that
                    is why we barely see each other and consider it lucky when we do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There were times that Ian initiated to wake up at around 4:00 AM, messaged me if he can fetch me up
                    at the gate of the
                    compound where I live at around 6:00 in the morning even if his school shift starts at 7:00 AM.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wind in my hair while my cheeks turning red as the breeze in the morning when the air was cold broke
                    my skin and bones
                    as I see him with a wide smile and awkward memento while we were walking together with the feels
                    that weâ€™re dancinâ€™ in
                    the kitchen in the refrigerator light as you waited for me to ride the tricycle in traveling to San
                    Isidro National High
                    School.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other than that, there were also times that we will be in shocked as we get to see each other
                    unintentionally in the
                    neighborhood 'cause we have some errands to do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Days after days, weeks after weeks, became almost 3 years of being mutually connected that were
                    considered memorable ones.

                    <b>Bumpy Roads</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place walking down the stairs like a never-needy,
                    ever-lovely jewel whose
                    shine reflects on him wherein the times we were still together time wonâ€™t fly like Iâ€™m paralyzed
                    by it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I suddenly felt that he has become like a 'ghost' where he will disappear for a few weeks and
                    suddenly be there saying
                    'I miss you and there was me, saying 'I miss you too' showing how I appreciate as I truly like him
                    and disappear again
                    repeatedly making me like Iâ€™m a crumpled up piece of paper lying while silently speaking â€˜I
                    might be OK but Iâ€™m not fine
                    at all.â€™ Tumbling down this situation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    â€¦And you call me up again just to break me like a promise, after the ghosting phases, I strictly
                    felt like there was
                    something cold that a twin flame bruises paint you blue in the relationship where â€˜fuck the
                    patriarchyâ€™ that I cannot
                    contain but to let go anymore as I don't feel a presence in those bumpy times before our
                    relationship ended.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Art of Letting Go</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I walk home alone, as I was the one who initiated the letting go phase last July 2020 when he
                    ghosted me for about a
                    month that time and I cannot hold on to the fact that I liked him and he was not reciprocating with
                    what my heart
                    occupies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After letting go of him, I cried, thinking that 'they say allâ€™s well that ends well, but Iâ€™m in
                    a new Hellâ€™ how it
                    became hard to be sentimental and hold on to memories when a person became significant.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Months after, I realized that â€œIâ€™ll get older, but your lovers stay my ageâ€ as I certainly had
                    the chance to move on
                    from that past mutual relationship.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Last April 2021â€” Ian and I, had a catch-up and this was the time I realized that I have moved on
                    already from liking
                    him. I know itâ€™s long gone and that magicâ€™s not here no more where Iâ€™d like to be my old self
                    again, but Iâ€™m still
                    trying to find it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That closure ended well as he apologized for what he did, however, last July 2021, the day when I
                    was in the online
                    contest for research in the division of Antipolo, I have seen a friend request with his name on my
                    Facebook profile. I
                    messaged him right away if that was intentional and he said yes because my Facebook Profile is on
                    set as locked.
                    Clarifying things through online messages, he just wanted to have someone who can talk to him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That quick catch-up together stopped by around the end of July as he disappeared again to what I
                    expected.

                    Sipping coffee beneath the silence of my room while setting up my earphones on the 12th of November
                    2021 while tuning in
                    the YouTube Premium has made it in the mood that I am feeling heartbroken with Taylor's past as well
                    as mine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While I listened to the song, I remember it all too well on the nights when you made me your own on
                    memories that made
                    me feel like a person inside All Too Well in portrayal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bringing back the time I walked through the door with youâ€” running scared â€˜cause it reminds you
                    of innocence and it
                    smells like me. But at the end of the day, youâ€™ve still got it as it is us within ourselves that
                    need to conquer the
                    droughts and changes we've been facing through.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From a sacred prayer, may you be well with a scarf that will give you comfort and not avoidance.
