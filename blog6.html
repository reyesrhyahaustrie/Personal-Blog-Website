                    Dear <b><em>world</em></b>, please consider my <b><em>illustrated</em></b> essay about how
                    <b><em>admiring U.S. Immigration Policy</em></b> taught me <b><em>the meaning of
                            power.</em></b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you, welcome to New York, welcome to New
                        York!</em> Taylor Swift imparted a
                    part of a song that has been instilled in us how modernized it is to be in that state of America.

                    <br>
                    Truth be told, every one of us often foresees our version of the American dream.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Being influenced by the ferocious blitz of foreign countries starting from their culture, more
                    opportunities, and
                    relatively high salaries made me wonder what is behind the U.S. Immigration Policy that is admirable
                    for a lot of people
                    to envision migrating from their country to the United States.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like every other young person in the Philippines, living simply but having dreams is the most
                    essential part when it
                    comes to the phase of adulthood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Looking for answers here and there what is the true meaning of the American Dream, I have come to
                    realize that the real
                    deal here is taking the risks without expectations, as much as gaining the benefits of the right
                    decisions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Philippines, the country that we continue to fight for, can still be a nation full of
                    opportunities that we can
                    still be hopeful for the future, but having plans of leaving is also a path crunching oneself to get
                    out of the comfort
                    zone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>U.S. Immigration Policy</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This immigration policy helped and assessed that yearly, there is an ongoing reunification of
                    families, admitting
                    immigrants with skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, protection of refugees, and promotion
                    of diversity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) enables the issuance of up to 675,000 permanent immigrant
                    visas per year.
                    Furthermore, the INA allows U.S. citizens' wives, parents, and children under the age of 21 to enter
                    the country at any
                    time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through the U.S. Immigration Policy, America has gained significant benefits from welcoming
                    immigrants, as well as
                    students, skilled workers, and others who may only be in the country for a short time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Power's Building Boulder</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hope is a force that empowers individuals and causes change, no matter how awful circumstances
                    appear to be. Thus,
                    choices beyond new choices, whereas the new dream is about what work you have, where you live, and
                    how you make
                    decisions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As cited by a survey, the American dream changes over time as these are not material things that
                    come at hand but the
                    freedom to live. Remember to be kind to yourself but always cherish the opportunities lining up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All the people, also in contrast to Filipinos who plan and have already migrated to America, once
                    lived for their dreams
                    and do not dig out a white picketed fence you typically see in movies. This set of diverse
                    individuals has come for more
                    opportunities to enrich a prosperous life where skills can be honed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Living the American Dream usually depicts becoming wealthy, but when unfiltered, it is
                    reaching the goals while
                    experiencing a fun and happy life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beating the ground up to the dreams, we are in charge of how we climb ourselves up to what POWER
                    means. It is indeed
                    that going out of my comfort zone taught me the meaning of power by facing challenges, embarking on
                    goals, contributing
                    to society, and lastly, making sense of what it is to live for.
