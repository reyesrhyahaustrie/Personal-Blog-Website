                    <em><b>On the morning my sister's cat, Esme, went missing, we were as frantic as the Greek king
                            Sisyphus moments after
                            receiving his boulder.</em></b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Esme's Organized Plan</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was a sunny day in the streets of Manila when Esme quickly went out without us knowing that she
                    wanted to find
                    someone who got her mesmerized a few days ago.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With twinkling eyes as she soul-search, she didn't think of any people but only herself and the love
                    for a guy cat
                    named, Hans.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other side of the coin, Hans peacefully sleeps on the carpet. But all of a sudden, a "meow"
                    brought him up to get
                    awakened by Esme that sneaked on his windows while sleeping.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As he got astounded by what he saw, he ran to the room of his owner, secretly blushing as he
                    identified himself in love
                    with the gorgeousness of Esme when he first saw her.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Where's Esme?</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, while Esme is looking for love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My sister panicked when she found out that Esme was missing as she never come back ever since 10
                    hours ago.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our mother thought that maybe, she was just looking for rodents. But my sister said that Esme
                    wouldn't do that as she is
                    a queen of prowess that will catch your heart and attention.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Believing in Love</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Awaiting the possibility that Esme will come back to our house that day, this was the first time my
                    heart pounded tears
                    of joy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Truly, happy endings only happen in fairytales. But Hans finally had the courage to meet Esme, and
                    they took the path to
                    our house like they were a stash of chocolate sweets walking down the aisle as newlyweds of the
                    town, in love with each
                    other
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Truly, <i><b>among beds of clouds, Esme was the queen.</i></b>
