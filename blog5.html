                    Only if I can transform myself in just 10-seconds just to not get comments that will make my
                    <em><b>heart break into a million
                            pieces:</em></b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b><i>â€œYou are</b> so fat.â€</i>
                    <br>
                    <b><i>â€œYou are</b> more beautiful when you lose weight.â€</i>
                    <br>
                    <b><i>â€œYou are</b> the person qualified for extra rice.â€</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These are their <i>only choice</i> of words that made me go back into the cage wherein I am filled
                    with insecurities that I
                    donâ€™t know how to fight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Growing up being that â€˜chubby girlâ€™, some were calling me cute, â€œoh wow, thanks for being
                    honest, thatâ€™s true.â€ Kidding
                    aside, the <i>back of my bone carries the weight of the world</i> from people I know that I should
                    lose weight just because I
                    get to <i>run slower</i> than their expectations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before, as I <i>my eyes</i> and <i>lift the voices behind my ears,</i> I get to hear that some kids
                    were fitting the societal
                    standards and they do not even have to deal with these hateful comments anymore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Being a bearer of the <i>fire watered</i> with self-love, this <i>suffering felt like thereâ€™s no
                        consolation,</i> for most of the
                    people will come to judge you as if you do not deserve to be in their circles.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Shortly Over There</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Back when it was in December 2019, I forced myself to lose weight to stop getting these bad comments
                    making my life
                    miserable. From 69 kilograms to 55 kilograms, the body-shaming Iâ€™ve received turned to:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>â€œYou are more beautiful when you were chubby.â€</i>
                    <br>
                    <i>â€œYou look so skinny.â€</i>
                    <br>
                    <i>â€œIs small the size of your shirt now? Thatâ€™s unbelievable.â€</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this world full of bad mouthful citizens, where should WE fit in?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The pile of confidence has turned into the darkness where <i><b>silence meets</i></b> <u><b>the
                            screams</u></b> through a window pane. Even in turns
                    of love, I remembered one of the guys with whom I had a talking stage before where he will point out
                    that I should lose
                    some <i><b>fats juggling beneath my body.</i></b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    People always think that it is easy to burn those calories and ignore those insecurities, in order
                    for you to fit their
                    standards. Society has been so messed up to the point that it is making a lot sick within their own
                    souls.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i><b>The life</i></b> filled with compassion became <i><b>the life</i></b> succumbed to dilemmas of
                    <i><b>the life</i></b> seeking acceptance. Truly, <u><b>peopleâ€™s
                            hearts are as fickle as falling petals,</u></b> especially those who are experiencing
                    <i><b>bittersweet sorrows.</i></b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    They pressured us that we gotta be all these things leading us to lose sight of who we were when we
                    listened to the
                    opinions of people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Be YOU!</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I tried to change <i><b>who I am,</i></b> I thought the others would accept me for <i><b>who I
                            am</i></b> and after a while, I realized I donâ€™t
                    know how to be anything but just show them <i><b>who I am.</i></b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i><b>Do not be blinded by other peopleâ€™s opinions</i></b> and live your own life. <i><b>Which is
                            why</i></b> this is the main reason to surround
                    yourself with those who are grateful and accept you for who you are.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For us to be able to change the game, this is a reminder to always be kind and love one another.
                    Learn how to embrace
                    diversities that will mold us to have a chaotic-free life and know that <u><b>you are
                            beautiful.</u></b>
