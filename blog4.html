                        Minding the habit from the quotation of Mahatma Gandhi, wherein he stated that "Happiness is
                        when what you think, what
                        you say, and what you do are in harmony", would definitely stitch an impact on everyone's lives.
                        In fact, it has been
                        instilled in my heart to be happy with the things I do since I was a kid.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Being the eldest kid in the family, I always knew that happiness leads to contentment. Apart
                        from the events that
                        happened to me as a toddler up to young adulthood does not necessarily mean that I should always
                        feel happy, for there
                        will always be times that things would not go like you planned.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, as life is a rollercoaster ride, we should be able to see things with positivity and
                        happiness, for us to
                        cherish everything that we do. For some, getting material things is what makes them happy and we
                        have to respect them.
                        But for me, what makes me happy is investing time into myself to be better; by serving the
                        community; hanging out with
                        friends and family; fulfilling my goals; being optimistic as much as I can; and lastly, valuing
                        the time that I have in
                        this world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a volunteer of different youth organizations here in the Philippines, my idea of happiness is
                        by the act of service
                        in being part of the change and peace-building. In my friends and family, I do love going out
                        with them to build a happy
                        and strong relationships as we have to live this life to the fullest. Lastly, as to myself, I
                        pledged that I would
                        always try in every opportunity that is aligned to my interests, for me to have improvements on
                        what I envision.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If we can make progress regularly, we would constantly feel alive and that's the secret to
                        making it a habit. Above all,
                        indulging in the things that one loves becomes the key to a happy life. Hence, love and
                        happiness are directly linked to
                        each other. Without love, happiness would not exist and might not result in someone's
                        contentment.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the whole, the key to happiness lies in doing what one loves. A lot of people end up having a
                        chaotic life, filled
                        with regrets; this happens because they settle for something that they do not genuinely like. We
                        must spend our time on
                        things that make us feel genuinely happy.
